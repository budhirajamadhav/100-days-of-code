# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't how to use time in golang, how memory management works in golang, poiinters and arrays in golang.

**Thoughts:** I may me going slow but keeping in mind "ek makaan ek din me nahi ban sakta chahe hazaron labour kyo na utha lao but dheeme dheeme roz consistently karo toh 1 saal me aisa banega ki dunia dekhti reh jayegi"

### Day 2: November 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't about slices, maps and structs in golang.
