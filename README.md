# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't how to use time in golang, how memory management works in golang, poiinters and arrays in golang.

**Thoughts:** I may me going slow but keeping in mind "ek makaan ek din me nahi ban sakta chahe hazaron labour kyo na utha lao but dheeme dheeme roz consistently karo toh 1 saal me aisa banega ki dunia dekhti reh jayegi"

### Day 4: November 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't about methods, handling files and defer keyword in golang.

**Thoughts:** These are important and to be revised stuff. Done with the syntactical basics today and starting with webrequests tomorrow, I could've started today but sinus trigger(I'm coming Dr.) and Diwali pollution came in and ruined the day. Doesn't matter if I did less, I did and that matters.

### Day 5: November 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't about handling URLs, webrequests in golang.

**Thoughts:** It was not a piece of cake to learn about these webrequests but prior knowledge helped and some important stuff like parsing response into string and **why should we close the connection were acknowledged**.

### Day 6: November 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't about creating and consuming JSON in golang.

**Thoughts:** Learn't many new things today, like json aliases in structs, how to marshal and unmarshal data, unmarshal in a struct or just key value pairs, interface{}.
