### Day 4: November 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't about methods, handling files and defer keyword in golang.

**Thoughts:** These are important and to be revised stuff. Done with the syntactical basics today and starting with webrequests tomorrow, I could've started today but sinus trigger(I'm coming Dr.) and Diwali pollution came in and ruined the day. Doesn't matter if I did less, I did and that matters.

### Day 5: November 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn't about handling URLs, webrequests in golang.

**Thoughts:** It was not a piece of cake to learn about these webrequests but prior knowledge helped and some important stuff like parsing response into string and **why should we close the connection were acknowledged**.
